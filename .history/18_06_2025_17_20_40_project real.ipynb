    "# Predicting Newsletter Subscription in Minecraft Players Using Age and Gameplay Hours\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pacific Laboratory for Artificial Intelligence (PLAI) research group in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia (UBC), led by Frank Wood, has developed a Minecraft server that records player behaviour to understand how people play video games. Managing this system involves ensuring server stability and cost-effective recruitment strategies for ongoing research. Understanding which player characteristics predict engagement (such as newsletter subscription) is essential for their efforts. Therefore, in this analysis, we try to answer the question: **Can a playerâ€™s age and played hours predict whether they subscribe to the newsletter?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To try and answer this question, we will use one data set that contain the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `experience` (character type): The player's experience level (Beginner/Amateur/Regular/Pro/Veteran)\n",
    "- `subscribe` (logical type): Whether the player subscribed to the newsletter (TRUE/FALSE)\n",
    "- `hashedEmail` (character type): Unique identifier for a player\n",
    "- `played_hours` (double type): Total hours the player spent in-game\n",
    "- `name` (character type): The player's name\n",
    "- `gender` (character type): The player's gender\n",
    "- `Age` (double type): Age of the player (in years)\n",
    "\n",
    "The player dataset has **196 rows and 7 columns**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods and Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to load the file."

Since we will be using a nearest neighbours classification, we do not want many predictors, since it could potentially slow our analysis (or even negatively affect it). Therefore, we select the `Age` and `played_hours` columns, since they are the only ones with integer values. We should also change our categorical variables to factors. Here, we must carefully consider missing values (the `drop_na` function can deal with them)."

Figure 1.0 showed that those within the range of roughly 15 to 27 years of age seem to subscribe more, and Figure 1.1 showed that those with more hours have more subscriptions (even though there is a large number of people who subscribed with few hours, those with many hours were all subscribed).\n",

This model was chosen because it is intuitive, requires few assumptions, and works well with nonlinear relationships.
